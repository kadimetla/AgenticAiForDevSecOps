1)	For this lab, we will need to make sure the build service will have permissions to interact with the git repository <br>
Click on project settings > repositories > security <br>
Select the ado-ai Build Service user and make sure the following are set to allow:<br>
bypass policies when pushing: Allow <br>
Contribute: Allow <br>
Create branch: Allow <br>
Create tag: Allow <br>
Read: allow <br>

<br/>

2)	Go back to GitHub Codespaces, and make sure you are on the main branch and pull changes

<br/>

3)	Input the following prompt in GitHub Copilot:

As a highly experienced release manager, help us release this application and add release notes, avoid using powershell.
Step 1: create a new branch for these changes
Step 2:  add a step in the azure devops pipeline to create the git tag for this release using semantic versioning 
Step 3: add a step in the azure devops pipeline to create the release notes in a changelog file
Step 4: add a step in the azure devops pipeline to zip the application and publish it as an artifact <br/>

<br/>

4)	Next, publish the branch (or commit changes if needed)
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-4.png)

<br/>

5)	Next, review the pipeline to make sure everything looks good:
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-5.png)

<br/>

6)	And merge it to the main branch by creating a pull request:
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-6.png)
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-6-2.png)
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-6-3.png)
<br/>

7)	 Unfortunately, the pipeline failed when running on the main branch due to an authentication error:
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-7.png)

<br/>

8)	Lets go back to codespaces and resolve this issue:
Make sure you are on the main branch, then pull latest changes
Then input the following prompt
```
The ‘<failed step display name>’ is running into an error:
<error message>. Create a new branch and fix this error
```
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-8.png)
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-8-2.png)

<br/>

9)	Next lets publish the branch:
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-9.png)

<br/>

10)	 And create a new pull request and merge it to main
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-10.png)

<br/>

11)	After merging the branch If the new pipeline in the main branch succeeded you should be able to see a tag with the version specified in the azure-pipeline.yml file
![image](./images/lab5/lab5-11.png)

<br/>

12)	As well as the artifacts which contain the changelog file
