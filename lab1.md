1.	For this lab, lets head on over to the GitHub Models playground: 

    [Github Marketplace models](https://github.com/marketplace/models)

    📝 **Note:** This feature is in preview, so results may vary.

<br/>

2.	Here is a quick overview of some of the models that can be used with GitHub Copilot:

    💳 Balance between cost and performance: Go with **GPT-5-mini**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, or **DeepSeek V3.2** for excellent quality at lower cost.

    🪙 Fast, lightweight tasks: **Phi-4-mini-instruct**, **Phi-4-mini-reasoning**, **o3-mini**, or **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** are your buddies.

    💎 Deep reasoning or complex debugging: Think **GPT-5-nano/mini with reasoning**, **o4-mini**, **o1-preview**, **Phi-4-reasoning**, or advanced proprietary models for multi-step problem solving.

    🖼️ Multimodal inputs (like images): Check out **Phi-4-multimodal-instruct**, **Gemini 2.0 Flash**, **GPT-5 series**, or **Gemma 4** for vision and multimodal capabilities.

    🧠 Advanced agentic workflows & tool use: Try **Gemma 4 (31B)**, **NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Super** (120B MoE), **Kimi K2**, or **Mistral Small 4** for reliable tool use and autonomous tasks.

    🔐 Open-source alternatives: **Mistral Small 4** (Apache 2.0), **Llama 3.1**, **Phi-4 series**, **Gemma 4**, or **DeepSeek V3.2** offer strong performance with transparency and flexibility.

<br/>

3. Let’s test out ‘one-shot prompting’.
    Select OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano then click on compare and select OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini

    📝 **Note:** if no models appear in the dropdown, click on any of the models at the bottom part of the ‘Welcome to GitHub Models’ screen. Some of the models may not be available during peak usage/high consumption.
 
    <br/>

     In the prompt area, enter the following:  
    "Write an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline to build a Python app and run tests."

    <br/>

    📝 **Note:** Nano should be extremely fast as its intended for use cases where latency and resource efficiency are important. 

<br/>

4. Next, lets test ‘few-shot prompting’
    Select OpenAI GPT-4.1 and Codestral 25.01 (Feel free to try out any model)

    ```yaml
    Write an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline for the given app type, including build and test stages:

    Example 1: App Type: Node.js
    Pipeline:

    trigger:
    - main
    pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - task: NodeTool@0
        inputs:
        versionSpec: '14.x'
    - script: npm install
    - script: npm test

    Example 2: App Type: Java Pipeline:
    trigger:
    - main
    pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
    steps:
    - task: Maven@3
        inputs:
        mavenPomFile: 'pom.xml'
        goals: 'clean test'

    Now write for: App Type: Python
    ```
    <br/>

    <br/>

    📝 **Note:** Notice how Codestral is a lot faster in this case, but less detailed than 

    <br/>

5. Now lets try ‘chain-of-thought prompting’
    Lets use Deepseek R1 vs Llama 4 Maverick for this test

    ```yaml
    Write an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline for a Python app, reasoning step-by-step to include build and test stages:
    Step 1: Identify the app type and its typical build requirements.
    Step 2: Determine necessary pipeline components (e.g., trigger, pool).
    Step 3: Select tasks for building and testing.
    Step 4: Construct the YAML with explanations.
    ```
    <br/>

    📝 **Note:** On some examples you may reach the maximum token limit for the output
    <br/>

6.  And next, we will try ‘role-based prompting’
    For this lets try OpenAI GPT-4.1 mini vs Llama 4 Scout 17B

    ```yaml
    As an Azure DevOps specialist with expertise in CI/CD automation, write an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline for a Python app, including build and test stages, optimized for a self-hosted agent:
    Ensure the pipeline is secure and efficient for branch validation.
    ```
